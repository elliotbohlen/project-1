The New UK Hacker's Manifesto (Y2K)

The Conscience of a Hacker Y2K version

By +++The Lamor+++
 
Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in 
Mobile Phone Scam", "Hacker Arrested after Newsgroup Flood"... Damn kids. 
They're all alike.
 
But did you, sat behind your prehistoric command line with your stupid, geeky 
1980's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you 
ever wonder what made him thick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded 
him?
 
I am a h4X0R, enter my world...
 
Mine is a world that begins with bunking off school... I'm better than most 
of the other kids, all they got for christmas was stupid furbies...
 
Spoilt Bastard. They're all alike.
 
I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the 
fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I don't understand it. "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't do my work. I stood outside the off-license all night
drinking alcopops..."
 
Damn kid. He's so goddam cool. I wish I was like him.
 
I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. I 
can impress my mates with my elite IRC skillz. If it makes a mistake, it's 
because It's been haxored up. Not because it doesn't like me... Everybody 
likes me.
 
Or feels threatened by me...
 
Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
 
Or doesn't like haxors and shouldn't be here...
 
Damn kid. All he does is get his face pierced. They're all alike. 
 
And then it happened... a door opened to a world... an electronic pulse is sent out, 
a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... I leeched a BTi 0800
number.

"This is it... this is where I belong...alt.ph.uk"
 
I hate everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, 
may never hear from them again... I hate you all...
 
Damn kid. screwing the back off his mobile again. They're all alike... 
 
You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been struggling to learn Visual 
Basic at school when we hungered for WinNuke... the lessons that I did turn 
up for were geekish and boring. We've been dominated by school bullies, or 
ignored by the in-crowd. The few that had something to teach found us 
ungrateful and greedy, but those few may as well bang their heads against a
wall.
 
This is our world now... the world of the C12 and the chip, the sex of the 
hex. We make use of the hard work of others without working for what could 
be downloaded from a warez site, and we call ourselves hackers. We steal 
code... and we call ourselves hackers. We leech your knowledge... and we call
ourselves hackers. We exist without morals, without ethics, without 
contributing anything... and we call ourselves hackers. You build networks, 
you give us exploits, you program, fix bugs, and lie to us and try to make us 
believe that we are lame, yet WE are the hackers.
 
Yes, I am a hacker. My hack is that of freeloading. My hack is that of 
judging people by what they can give me, not what they can do. My hack is 
that of having it all given to me, nicely packaged to run on windows 98, and 
that is something that you will never forgive me for.
 
I am a HaXoR, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you 
can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world...  an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
