Robert clearly and authoritatively described this phenomenon in his seminal essay The End of Books: “Print documents may be read in hyperspace, but hypertext does not translate into print”,26 and so the endlessly deep narrative space made possible by the hypertext seemed destined to supplant the finite, sequential and closed format of books, eventually making them altogether obsolete. 
According, the ‘superior’ form of the hypertext brings “true freedom from the tyranny of the line” – particularly so in the case of narrative-based text. When the boundless cultural space of the ‘hypertextual’ global Web is finally opened up, will the printed page by comparison start to look like so much yellowed paper?

FUCK THE CLOUD.
By the cloud, of course, I mean this idea that you have a local machine, a box running some OS, and a vital, distinct part of what you do and what you’re about or what you consider important to you is on other machines that you don’t run, don’t control, don’t buy, don’t administrate, and don’t really understand. 
These machines are connected via the internet, and if you have a company then these other machines are not machines run by your company, and if you’re a person they are giving it to you without you signing anything accompanied by cash or payment that says “and I mean it“.

Can I be clearer than that? It’s a sucker’s game. It’s a game suckers play. 
If you are playing it, you are a sucker.
