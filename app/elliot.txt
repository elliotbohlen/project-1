Now technology makes it easy to express emotions while they are being formed. 
It supports an emotional style in which feelings are not fully experienced until they are communicated.  
What is not being cultivated here is the ability to be alone and reflect on one’s emotions in private.  Turn from an inner to an other-directed sense of self.

college friends were visiting and mom was listening to the garden twins when we arrived.

Sydney was over and i told her to open the porch door so calvin could leave before we went to bed... obvi he left and then in the morning i freaked out and went to find him and he was on the edge of the bordering building just chilling and watching the street below.

Carol had a lottery ticket and said she won a small sum and i was like ooh let me see and i scratched off all the other ones to see what was there but accidental made it so she wouldn’t get the prize.

Robert Coover clearly and authoritatively described this phenomenon in his seminal essay The End of Books: “Print documents may be read in hyperspace, but hypertext does not translate into print”,26 and so the endlessly deep narrative space made possible by the hypertext seemed destined to supplant the finite, sequential and closed format of books, eventually making them altogether obsolete. 
According to Coover, the ‘superior’ form of the hypertext brings “true freedom from the tyranny of the line” – particularly so in the case of narrative-based 28 text. When the boundless cultural space of the ‘hypertextual’ global Web is finally opened up, will the printed page by comparison start to look like so much yellowed paper?
